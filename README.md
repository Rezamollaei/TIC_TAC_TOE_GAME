This program is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ where a player can play against the computer. Let's break down the key sections of the program:

1. Game Structure
The board is represented as an array of 9 characters (a 3x3 grid), where each cell can be 'X', 'O', or ' ' (empty).
The user is assigned to play with 'X' and the computer uses 'O'.
The game continues in turns: the player makes a move, followed by the computer's move.
The game checks for a winner or a tie after each move.
2. Functions Overview
drawBoard(char *spaces):

This function prints the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board to the console.
It uses the values from the spaces array to display the board in a 3x3 grid format.
playerMove(char *spaces , char player):

Prompts the player to choose a number between 1 and 9 (corresponding to board positions).
Checks if the chosen spot is empty (' '), and if so, places the player's marker ('X') in that spot.
computerMove(char *spaces, char computer):

The computer randomly picks a number between 0 and 8 (inclusive) and places its marker ('O') in an empty spot on the board.
Uses rand() to generate a random number and time(0) to ensure the randomness is different each time the program is run.
checkWinner(char *spaces , char player , char computer):

Checks the current state of the board to see if there is a winner.
The function checks all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals).
If the player or the computer has won, it prints the result and ends the game.
checkTie(char *spaces):

Checks if all spots on the board are filled and there is no winner.
If the board is full and there's no winner, it declares a tie.
3. Main Program Logic
The game begins by drawing the initial empty board.
The game then enters a loop where the player and the computer take turns making moves.
After each move, the board is redrawn and the program checks if there is a winner or a tie.
If there is a winner or the game ends in a tie, the loop breaks, and the game concludes with a message.
4. Winning Condition
The program checks for a winner by verifying all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals).
If a player or the computer achieves one of these combinations (e.g., a row filled with 'X' or 'O'), the game ends and declares the winner.
5. Tie Condition
If all spots on the board are filled (' '), but no one has won, it declares a tie.
6. Improvements / Bug Fixes
Typo in Winner Check: In the checkWinner function, the equality check (==) in spaces[0] == player is mistakenly written as spaces[0] == player ? std::cout << "You Winn!!" : std::cout << "You lose!!"; which should be handled properly. You may want to refactor the logic so that it correctly handles this.

No Replay Option: The game ends after one round, and there's no option to replay. You might want to ask the player if they want to play again at the end of the game.

Conclusion:
This program provides a working version of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where a player competes against a randomly playing computer. It covers basic game mechanics like board drawing, player input, computer AI, and checks for both win and tie conditions.
